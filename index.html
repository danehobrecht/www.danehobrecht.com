								<i>These Shining Lives</i> chronicles the strength 
								and determination of women considered expendable in 
								their day, exploring their true story and its 
								continued resonance. Catherine Donohue and her 
								friends have loving families and good jobs painting 
								glow-in-the-dark watch faces at Chicago’s Radium 
								Dial Company, and the 1920s seem full of promise. 
								The war is over, the economy booming, and Catherine 
								bobs her hair and treats the girls to banana splits 
								to celebrate their new prosperity. The tragedy 
								comes when Catherine and her colleagues begin 
								falling ill, one by one, with mystifying ailments. 
								When the cause of their symptoms finally becomes 
								clear, Catherine and her friends must find a way to 
								deal with their own inconvenient truth: that the 
								job they love has betrayed them. This is a story of 
								survival in its most transcendent sense, as these 
								women refuse to allow the company that stole their 
								health to kill their spirits or endanger the lives 
								of those who come after them.

								Step into the enchanted world of Broadway's classic,
								Disney's <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, an
								international sensation that has been produced in 37
								countries worldwide. Based on the Academy
								Award-winning animated feature, the stage version
								includes all of the wonderful songs written by Alan
								Menken and the late Howard Ashman, along with new
								songs by Mr. Menken and Tim Rice. The original
								Broadway title ran for over thirteen years and was
								nominated for nine Tony Awards, including Best
								Musical.<br><br>The classic story tells of Belle, a
								young woman in a provincial town, and the Beast, who
								is really a young prince trapped under the spell of
								an enchantress. If the Beast can learn to love and
								be loved, the curse will end and he will be
								transformed into his former self. But time is
								running out. If the Beast does not learn his lesson
								soon, he and his household will be doomed for all
								eternity.<br><br>This "tale as old as time" is
								filled with spectacular costume and set
								opportunities or, even more simply staged, Disney's
								Beauty and the Beast offers a great opportunity to
								bring your entire community together for family
								theatre at its best.

								<i>Our Town</i> is a 1938 metatheatrical
								three-actplay by American playwright Thornton
								Wilder. It tells the story of the fictional American
								small town of Grover's Corners between 1901 and 1913
								through the everyday lives of its citizens.<br><br>
								Throughout, Wilder uses metatheatrical devices,
								setting the play in the actual theatre where it is
								being performed. The main character is the stage
								manager of the theatre who directly addresses the
								audience, brings in guest lecturers, fields
								questions from the audience, and fills in playing
								some of the roles. The play is performed without a
								set on a mostly bare stage. With a few exceptions,
								the actors mime actions without the use of props.
								<br><br>The first performance of <i>Our Town</i> was
								at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey on
								January 22, 1938. It went on to success on Broadway
								and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Described
								by Edward Albee it is "the greatest American play
								ever written". <i>Our Town</i> is popular today with
								frequent revivals.
