								<i>Sweeney Todd</i> has become a bloody, worldwide
								success since being awarded eight Tony's, (including
								Best Musical), for its Broadway premiere. Stephen
								Sondheim's and Hugh Wheeler's (A Little Night Music,
								Pacific Overtures) tasty, thrilling, theatrical
								treat has simultaneously shocked, awed and delighted
								audiences across the world.<br><br>An infamous tale,
								Sweeney Todd, an unjustly exiled barber, returns to
								nineteenth century London, seeking vengeance against
								the lecherous judge who framed him and ravaged his
								young wife. The road to revenge leads Todd to Mrs.
								Lovett, a resourceful proprietress of a failing pie
								shop, above which, he opens a new barber practice.
								Mrs. Lovett's luck sharply shifts when Todd's thirst
								for blood inspires the integration of an ingredient
								into her meat pies that has the people of London
								lining up... and the carnage has only just begun!
								<br><br>Extremely popular with opera companies and
								in concert presentation, <i>Sweeney Todd</i> is
								equally effective as an intimate chamber musical.
								Featuring two unforgettable star turns and some of
								the most chilling music ever written for the stage,
								this masterpiece is sure both to thrill and delight
								audiences.

								When Ren and his mother move from Chicago to a small

								adjustment period at his new high school. But he’s
								not prepared for the rigorous local edicts,
								including a ban on dancing instituted by the local

								daughter sets her sights on Ren, her roughneck
								boyfriend tries to sabotage Ren’s reputation, with
								many of the locals eager to believe the worst about
								the new kid. The heartfelt story that emerges pins a
								father longing for the son he lost against a young
								man aching for the father who walked out on him.<br>
								<br>To the rockin’ rhythm of its Oscar and
								Tony-nominated Top 40 score, augmented with dynamic
								new songs, <i>Footloose</i> celebrates the wisdom of
								listening to young people while guiding them with a
								warm heart and open mind.

								and score are both enchanting and touching.<br><br>
								The story follows a Baker and his wife, who wish to
								have a child; Cinderella, who wishes to attend the
								King's Festival; and Jack, who wishes his cow would
								give milk. When the Baker and his wife learn that
								they cannot have a child because of a Witch's curse,
								the two set off on a journey to break the curse.
								Everyone's wish is granted, but the consequences of
								their actions return to haunt them later with
								disastrous results.<br><br>One of Sondheim's most
								popular works, <i>Into the Woods</i> is a musically
								sophisticated show with the opportunity to feature
								actors adept at dark comedy. Designers will
								especially enjoy highlighting the fantastical
								elements of this magical word.

								<i>Our Town</i> is a 1938 metatheatrical
								three-actplay by American playwright Thornton
								Wilder. It tells the story of the fictional American
								small town of Grover's Corners between 1901 and 1913
								through the everyday lives of its citizens.<br><br>
								Throughout, Wilder uses metatheatrical devices,
								setting the play in the actual theatre where it is
								being performed. The main character is the stage
								manager of the theatre who directly addresses the
								audience, brings in guest lecturers, fields
								questions from the audience, and fills in playing
								some of the roles. The play is performed without a
								set on a mostly bare stage. With a few exceptions,
								the actors mime actions without the use of props.
								<br><br>The first performance of <i>Our Town</i> was
								at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey on
								January 22, 1938. It went on to success on Broadway
								and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Described
								by Edward Albee it is "the greatest American play
								ever written". <i>Our Town</i> is popular today with
								frequent revivals.
